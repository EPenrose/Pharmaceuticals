Module 5 Challenge
Utilizing class learning and AskBCS, in completing this challenge. 
My analysis of the data is as follows:
-Ramicane appears to exert the most significant influence when comparing the final tumor volumes of Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin.

-The correlation between mouse weight and the average final tumor volume (at that weight) is notably strong for Capomulin.

-Among the top four regimens, Infubinol was the sole regimen that exhibited potential outliers.

-Based on the data, it can be inferred that Ramicane is the most effective treatment, closely followed by Capomulin.
